[S3]
(Simple Storage Service) max 5TB >=3AZs 119's
- WORM : Write Once Read Many
- versioning files. If disabled and file deleted, no way to recover files
- MFA to prevent causal deletion 
- concept of delete markers (file stays; analogous to audit log)
- by default all previous versions are private
- S3 object lock : compliance (no update); governance
- encryption SSL/SSE
- replication a/c regions

S3 - types
1. S3 standard
2. S3 Std Infrequent Access (msec)
3. S2 1 Zone IA
4. Glacier 1hr
5. Glacier Deep Archive 12hrs / cheapest
6. S3 Intelligent Control IC

[EC2]
~VM (Elastic Compute Cloud)

EC2 Pricing:
- On Demand - pay by sec/hr, short time, flexible, test/dev
- Reserved (1-3 yrs; 72% discount on hourly charge) - predictable usage 
- Spot (supply-demand; save upto 90% cost from on-demand)
    image rendering, algorithmic trading, flexible on compute capacity, no guaranteed uptime, dont use for persistent data
      set max Spot price, 2 mins to choose
      Spot block (1-6hrs) : block from terminating
      Spot + Persistent Request : Cancel Spot Request and then terminate Spot Instances
      Spot Fleets (spot instances + on-demand instances)
- Dedicated - physical machine, most $
    regulatory (special licensing requirements like per socket/per core/per VM) compliance requirements

IAM - always use roles instead of hardcoding your credentials
Polices control role's permissions
Security Groups - all inbound traffic blocked by default, all outboung traffic allowed
  all changes take effect immediately
bootstrap scripts runs at root level (user data)
metadata is data about EC2 instances

Networking:
- ENI elastic network interface; low $
- EN enhanced networking 10-100Gbps; ENA or VirtualFunctionInterface
- EFA elastic fabric adapter; high performance computing, ML, OS-bypass

Placement Groups: 
logical grouping EC2 instances depending on what you want to do (certain types of instances can be launched)
- Cluster: low n/w latency, high througput, same AZ 
- Spread: distinct underlying hardware (usecase - db HA)
- Partition: different rack (dedicated n/w & power sources) Eg HDFS, HBase, Cassandra
can't merge placement groups
can move instances only after they're in stopped state
