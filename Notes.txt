[S3]
(Simple Storage Service) max 5TB >=3AZs 119's
- WORM : Write Once Read Many
- versioning files. If disabled and file deleted, no way to recover files
- MFA to prevent causal deletion 
- concept of delete markers (file stays; analogous to audit log)
- by default all previous versions are private
- S3 object lock : compliance (no update); governance
- encryption SSL/SSE
- replication a/c regions

S3 - types
1. S3 standard
2. S3 Std Infrequent Access (msec)
3. S2 1 Zone IA
4. Glacier 1hr
5. Glacier Deep Archive 12hrs / cheapest
6. S3 Intelligent Control IC

[EC2]
~VM (Elastic Compute Cloud)

EC2 Pricing:
- On Demand - pay by sec/hr, short time, flexible, test/dev
- Reserved (1-3 yrs; 72% discount on hourly charge) - predictable usage 
- Spot (supply-demand; save upto 90% cost from on-demand)
    image rendering, algorithmic trading, flexible on compute capacity, no guaranteed uptime, dont use for persistent data
      set max Spot price, 2 mins to choose
      Spot block (1-6hrs) : block from terminating
      Spot + Persistent Request : Cancel Spot Request and then terminate Spot Instances
      Spot Fleets (spot instances + on-demand instances)
- Dedicated - physical machine, most $
    regulatory (special licensing requirements like per socket/per core/per VM) compliance requirements

IAM - always use roles instead of hardcoding your credentials
Polices control role's permissions
Security Groups - all inbound traffic blocked by default, all outboung traffic allowed
  all changes take effect immediately
bootstrap scripts runs at root level (user data)
metadata is data about EC2 instances

Networking:
- ENI elastic network interface; low $
- EN enhanced networking 10-100Gbps; ENA or VirtualFunctionInterface
- EFA elastic fabric adapter; high performance computing, ML, OS-bypass

Placement Groups: 
logical grouping EC2 instances depending on what you want to do (certain types of instances can be launched)
- Cluster: low n/w latency, high througput, same AZ 
- Spread: distinct underlying hardware (usecase - db HA)
- Partition: different rack (dedicated n/w & power sources) Eg HDFS, HBase, Cassandra
can't merge placement groups
can move instances only after they're in stopped state

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[EBS]
(Elastic Block Storage) - virtual hard disk attached to virtual EC2, production workloads, auto replicated; 1 AZ - same as EC2
SSD (IO optimized, HA)
  - gp2 General Purpose SSD : boot device volumes, install OS
  - gp3 : high performance hadoop, analytics, Cassandra (this is 4x faster than max gp2)
  - io1 Provisioned IOPS : high-performance DB, latency senstive, OLTP
  - io2 : same $ as io1, 5 9's durability
HDD (throughput optimized, can't be boot volumes)
  - st1 Throughput Optimized HDD : big data, ETL, log processing, data warehousing
  - sc1 Cold HDD lowest $, use file server

we need min 1 volume per EC2 - root device volums
volumes exist on EBS whereas snapshot are stored on S3 (photo of volume) - point in time copy of voulme; 
stop instance before snapshot; can share snapshots a/c accounts and regions

EBS Encryption - AES256
encrypt EC2 instance -> create snapshot -> copy snapshot with encrypt -> create image ami -> deployed on EC2
EC2 Hibernation preserves in mem RAM to EBS <150GB, much faster to boot up, 60 days or less, avail for on-demand & reserved instances

EFS Elastic File System
managed NFS, multiple AZ (shared storage) very $, encryption at rest KMS, pay per use, scale upto Petabytes
Usecases - wordpress, content mgmt, web server farms
FSx (Windows) SMB (ServerMessageBlock) - migrating AD, IIS, sharepoint; centralized storage for native MS application
FSx Lustre Performance - high speed high capacity distributed storage; financial modelling, HPC

AMI - blueprint for EC2
EBS volumes (stopped & data not lost, can be rebooted with no loss of data, root vol can be [optional] saved on termination) vs 
InstanceStore volumes (ephemeral storage, cannot stop, can be rebooted with no loss of data, root vol deleted on termination)

AWS backup gives you consolidation, can be used in conjuction with AWS Organization, encrypted, enforce polices lyfecycle mgmt, audit

[DB]
RDS
  multi AZ (no acces to underlying EC2 OS) - sql, oracel, mysql, postgresql, mariadb, Aurora
  OLTP - large transactions; RDS is not suitable for OLAP online analytical processing - bid data; use Redshift
  Read Replica (automatic backup needed) is for boosting performance whereas multi AZ is for Disater Recovery Failover
Aurora
  3 types of replicas - Aurora, mysql, postgresql
  - 10 G storage auto scale, 2 copies in each AZ = 6 copies of data
  performance of Aurora but spiky workloads - Aurora serverless
Dynamo DB
  non relational/no-sql db - mobile, gaming, IOT; pay per request; charge for syorage/backups; KMS; IAM
  SSD storage, 3 geographic DataCenters regions; eventual consistentcy (1sec)
  DAX (accelerator) 10x perf improvement
  ACID - atomic(all/nothing), consistent, isolated, durable -> use dynamodb transactions
  PITR (point in time recovery; not enabled by default; last 35 days, 5 mins increments)
  Streams - time ordered sequence FIFO, stored 24hrs, globally distributed multi-master with global tables,
